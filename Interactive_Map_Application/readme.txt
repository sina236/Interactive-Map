Western_Interactive_Map_Application v1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction

With a campus as large as UWO, navigating can be very overwhelming. Buildings are large, have many floors, and sometimes, quite frankly, the layouts make no sense at all. Getting from building to building is easy enough, which is why we are in dire need of some sort of software to help navigation indoors too. Using the maps provided on the UWO website as PDFs, we can develop a software displaying these maps, along with additional information which the maps miss out on, altogether in one place accessible from the software created.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What does this program do?

This Java application provides an interactive map for Western University. It allows users to navigate through the campus and buildings, display different points of interest depending on how the user would like to filter them, search through points of interest, list what is available in each building, as well as add custom points of interest as the user pleases.
